### Extract

- FIX: try to use plugin only if `target` setting is not set or has some special value (fixes #7)
  - For every builder tasks (except `find`) `build` value should be used. To set specific command its name should be starts with `build:` prefix, i.e. `build:lint` for `lint`.

## 1.3.0 (February 16, 2016)

- **NEW**: basic plugins support similar to dev-server (replacement for preprocess settings). See example [basisjs-tools-babel-plugin](https://github.com/wuzyk/basisjs-tools-babel-plugin) by @wuzyk

- make `basis.js` config parse error as fatal
- support for images in `<meta name="msapplication-*">`
- fix: exception on html extract when `<link>` has no `href` attribute
- make template isolate prefix reproducible (preparation for script and style freeze, `basis.js` support required)
- take in account special comment (`/* basisjs-tools:disable-warnings */`) in css to avoid warnings for this file
- improve warnings about missed files
- warn on broken links (fatal) in some missed hard cases (didn't check before):
    - reference by namespace in template, i.e. `<b:include src="foo.bar"/>`
    - broken links in markup `l10n` tokens (warn doesn't add to flow)
